"""
Feature library for behavior datasets.

This module provides a collection of features for behavioral analysis.
Features are automatically registered on import via the @register_feature decorator.

All features are automatically loaded when the feature_library is imported,
making them available in the global FEATURES registry.

Usage
-----
>>> from behavior import Dataset
>>> from behavior.dataset import FEATURES
>>>
>>> # Features are auto-registered and available by name
>>> dataset.run_feature(feature="speed-angvel", params={...})
>>>
>>> # Or by class
>>> from behavior import feature_library
>>> dataset.run_feature(
...     feature=feature_library.speed_angvel.SpeedAngvel,
...     params={...}
... )
>>>
>>> # List all registered features
>>> print(list(FEATURES.keys()))
